# Temporary blog landing page
Hello! If you are reading this, then you probably know me from Open Sauce, and got here via a buisness card. If that is the case, then hello! And thanks for taking a card! That was the best event I have ever been to. \
<br>
This isn't my normal blog, but my selfhosted server decided to fail over the Open Sauce weekend, and it is currently 1 AM and I am exhausted from exhibiting, so I am throwing togethor this temporary landing page. \
<br>
I will get my blog working in like 24 hours for sure, so please do check again later! Sorry about the inconvenience, Linux is hard to get working sometimes, especially when running a web server...
